            <PrimaryText>As a creative kid, I’ve always been fascinated by intricate details, colours and aesthetics. I'm growing to combine my observational skills and technical knowledge from engineering to design more consciously. 🌏</PrimaryText>
            <PrimaryText>My goal is to build things I design, hence I'm always learning and unlearning. 🌈</PrimaryText>
            <PrimaryText>When I'm not on Figma, I'm jamming to some questionable songs 🎶, creating digital art/illustrations 🎨 or enjoying some cat videos. 💤 </PrimaryText>
